Dear Alex,
Thank you for showing such strong interest in Engineering as a Career.  Nearly half of our engineers are Baby Boomers and have retirement looming.  This makes it imperative that we do all we can to keep our STEM pipeline filled.
On your April 18th Job Shadow visit to our Littleton, Colorado facility, we were able to meet with engineers of several different disciplines, including Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Software Engineering.  We were also able to visit our Virtual Reality Lab, visit the control room where we fly spacecraft around Mars, and see the world’s largest 6 degree of freedom robot.  I hope you enjoyed the chance to suit-up and enter the clean room where Arabsat and Hellas-sat are being assembled and tested.  Nothing like seeing a giant satellite up close to give you an understanding of the systems and complexity.
As a high school student showing initiative in exploring engineering, you are exactly what we are looking for.
Get that engineering degree and I would be happy to help find you a place in Lockheed Martin.  As soon as you are sophomore status, I can help you land an internship.
Please work hard on your math and science skills and please stay in touch.

Thanks again for visiting our site and considering us for your future employment,
Jim

                        <p class=light>– In July of 2016 I spent two weeks in Manhatten doing an internship with Sansi Corporation, makers of LED boards used in Times Square and in large stadiums around the world.  My time was divided between a live construction site installing a 138’ tall LED board 10 stories up on 7th avenue, and working in their corporate offices on various projects.
My role at the construction site was to document, with photos and text all that occurred.  I was typically on site for 4-5 hours each morning starting at 5 AM so I was able to see and document a great deal of activity.  My report was published on line and read by architects, project managers, owners and contractors.  One of my many takeaways was how well the planners and contractors worked with the crane operators to ensure not only safe movement of very large board sections, but that this was happening in times square with little or no impact on traffic.
While in the office, I was asked to work on several projects.  My first task was to redesign how the individual LED sections (many small sections plug into a board to create a very large image) attach to the board, allowing 4 keyholes to actuate (attach to) 8 different locations.  I was able to improve on the design and created a system to use just 2 keyholes to actuate 6 locations.
The next assignment was to reorganize their office space to expand work stations from 11 to 15 people in very limited space.  I was able to provide a drawing with my suggestion that accomplished the task.
My last project was to interface a PlayStation into their computer system that would allow them to demonstrate the interface with live boards for client presentations.  I successfully created the interface and suddenly realized I actually had live control of one of their boards already in Times Square….a very brief feeling of incredible power came over me but I resisted the temptation to say hello to NY from Alex.

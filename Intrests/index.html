                <p class=light> My family has gone hiking for as long as I can remember and it’s become a real love of mine as well.    Earlier this summer we visited the Colorado National Monument, Moab Utah (some great hikes in Arches Ntl Park along with two 100’ repelling adventures and an amazing hike to Maroon Bells in Aspen CO, even crossing the continental divide in the process.  A whirlwind and tiring week but lots of fun.</p>

                <p class=light>Our latest effort was the north end of the Bartram Trail in western NC (about 30 miles in 3 days), capped off by a 5 mile 3,000 ft elevation climb to the top of Cheoah Bald to watch the Solar Eclipse in totality this past summer.  It was nothing short of amazing

            <article class=body>
                <p class=light>For as long as I can remember I’ve been fascinated with electronics.  Not just a “Aren’t they cool” sort of thing but wanting to know how things really work, and how are they built.  My first big effort was to learn how to build my own computer.  I didn’t have a lot of cash so I researched how to build the fastest computer for the best value.  Hours or learning and instructional you tube videos paid off and I built my own computer in XXX grade and with a few minor enhancements, I’m still using it today.  I am now asked regularly to trouble shoot our friends and neighbors computer issues and am actually coaching a younger friend how to build his own computer.
I chose as personal project in 10th grade to build a RC airplane from scratch.  I designed the plane, learned what components are needed and how they work together, purchased the parts and taught myself wiring and soldering.  The plane flew beautifully.  Now I want to learn welding.</p>

                <p class=light>I was a part of the rockstar lakenorman cheer team from 2016 to 2017. Our team was level 4 stunting, and level 2 tumbling, however I was at level 4 in my tumbling. We started out poorly, but at the end of the season we improved a huge amount and won a paid gold bid to the national championships at disney. </p>            </article>
